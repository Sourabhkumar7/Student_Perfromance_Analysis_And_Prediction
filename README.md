Completed an advanced Student Performance Analysis and Prediction system featuring a user-friendly Flask interface. This project integrates a CI/CD pipeline for seamless data handling, employing Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data visualization.

The system utilizes the powerful Lasso regression algorithm, achieving an impressive 99.9% accuracy during training, to predict student academic performance based on inputted details. Additionally, I implemented robust error logging using Python's logging module and handled exceptions systematically to ensure smooth operation and quick resolution of issues.
Furthermore, I incorporated DVC and MLflow to track and manage data versions, parameters, and pipeline changes, ensuring reproducibility and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

Technology Used: Pandas, NumPy, Flask, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Lasso Regression, CI/CD pipeline, DVC, MLflow, Data Preprocessing, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Error Logging, Exception Handling.
